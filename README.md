Any sugestions, comments or bug reports welcome.

## Why to use it?

Pros:
 
 * if you are familiar with OptionParser you use the same calling syntax 
   and operation
 
 * no need to add other gems or, even worse, that gems' dependences

Cons:
 
 * you tell me :)

Known problems:
 
 * not managed (i.e. breaks) if user calls directly order!() or order()

## How to use

There is no gem installation available for the moment, so you can:

 * Grab the file **suiteparse.rb**

 * Put it in any accesible place (for example your application
   or lib directory)

 * require it!

**For an example of use please see the test example at the end of the file!**
